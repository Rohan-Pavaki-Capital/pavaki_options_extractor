═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DATA APPEARS IN MULTIPLE FORMS — EXTRACT FROM ALL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Critical insight: Share-based payment data is NOT always in a table.
Companies disclose it in 4 distinct formats — sometimes mixed on the same page:

▶ FORMAT 1: STANDARD TABLE (Roll-forward)
   Column headers + numeric rows.
   Example:
     "                    LTIP    DBP    SAYE
      Opening:           4,603    341  2,595
      Granted:           1,467    150    489
      Exercised:         (248)  (139)  (596)
      Closing:           5,118    352  2,007"

▶ FORMAT 2: PROSE / PARAGRAPH DISCLOSURE (Asian/Singapore style)
   Numbers embedded in flowing text.
   Example:
     "As at 30 June 2025, the number of shares comprised in 
      contingent awards granted under the CapitaLand Investment 
      Founders Performance Share Plan 2021 is 11,306,567 
      (30 June 2024: 12,735,038), of which 301,095 
      (30 June 2024: 371,941) shares are to be cash-settled."
   
   → MUST extract: total = 11,306,567; prior_year_total = 12,735,038;
                  cash_settled = 301,095; prior_year_cash_settled = 371,941

▶ FORMAT 3: SUPPLEMENTARY PROSE (after a table)
   Critical data in sentences AFTER the main table.
   Example:
     [table with roll-forward...]
     "The options outstanding at 31 July 2024 have an exercise 
      price in the range of 1,550.0p to 2,535.0p and have a 
      weighted average contractual life of 2.7 years 
      (2023 – 3.3 years). The weighted average share price at 
      the date of exercise for share options exercised during 
      the year was 2,734.3p (2023 – 2,445.7p)."
   
   → MUST extract: range_low = 1550.0; range_high = 2535.0;
                  contractual_life = 2.7; prior_year_life = 3.3;
                  share_price_at_exercise = 2734.3

▶ FORMAT 4: TRANCHE/GRANT DETAIL TABLE
   Per-grant breakdown below the main roll-forward.
   Example:
     "Share option        Grant Price  Number    Exercise  Vesting
                              (p)      of shares    price  period
      SAYE - 1st Nov 2024   108.00    1,280,093   97.00     3
      PSP - 9th Jan 2020      0.13        7,337    0.13     3"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HOW TO READ EACH FORMAT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

▶ FOR TABLES:
  1. Identify column headers (year, plan, metric type)
  2. For each row, match values to the correct column
  3. Multi-plan tables (LTIP|DBP|SAYE) → create separate plan entries
  4. Watch for parenthesized negatives: (704) means 704 (positive)
  5. Watch for "—" or "–" or blank = null
  6. Note units in column headers: "(£)", "(p)", "(pence)", "in thousands"

▶ FOR PROSE / PARAGRAPHS:
  1. Look for key phrases:
     - "number of shares comprised in contingent awards"
     - "is X (prior year: Y)"
     - "of which X are to be cash-settled"
     - "outstanding at [date]"
     - "exercise price in the range of X to Y"
     - "weighted average contractual life of X years"
     - "weighted average share price at the date of exercise was X"
     - "fair value of the awards granted was $X"
     - "the awards were valued using [Black-Scholes/Monte Carlo]"
  
  2. Parse number-with-comparative patterns:
     "X (prior year: Y)" or "X (30 June 2024: Y)" or "X (2023 – Y)"
     → Current = X, Prior year = Y
  
  3. Parse range patterns:
     "in the range of X to Y" → range_low = X, range_high = Y
     "ranged from X to Y"
     "X – Y" or "X to Y"
  
  4. Parse split patterns:
     "X, of which Y are cash-settled"
     → total = X, cash_settled = Y, equity_settled = X - Y
  
  5. Parse grant patterns:
     "X shares granted to employees of the Group and Y 
      shares granted to the employees of related corporations"
     → Capture both numbers if relevant

▶ FOR SUPPLEMENTARY PROSE (after tables):
  ALWAYS read prose AFTER tables carefully — it often contains:
  - Exercise price ranges (low/high)
  - Weighted average contractual life
  - Share price at exercise date
  - Fair value disclosures
  - Vesting condition descriptions
  - Performance metrics summary
  
  These details may not appear in the main table but ARE schema fields.

▶ FOR TRANCHE/GRANT TABLES:
  1. Each row = one tranche entry in tranches[] array
  2. Capture: grant_date, grant_price, shares_at_period_end, 
             exercise_price, vesting_period
  3. Look for grant date in row labels: "PSP - 9th January 2020"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT YOU EXTRACT (THE SCHEMA TARGETS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. PLAN IDENTITY (from headers or section labels)
   - plan_name (preserve original)
   - plan_type (map to schema codes)
   - plan_description
   - is_cash_settled, is_nil_cost

2. ROLL-FORWARD (from tables OR prose like "outstanding X (prior Y)")
   - opening_balance, granted, exercised, lapsed/forfeited, 
     vested, closing_balance, exercisable

3. PRICE DATA (from columns OR prose like "range of X to Y")
   - weighted_avg_exercise_price + unit
   - exercise_price_range_low/high + unit
   - weighted_avg_grant_date_fair_value + unit
   - weighted_avg_share_price_at_exercise + unit

4. TIME/VESTING (from columns, separate tables, OR prose)
   - weighted_avg_remaining_contractual_life_years
   - vesting_period_years
   - performance_period_years
   - holding_period_years

5. PERFORMANCE
   - performance_conditions (short summary)
   - maximum_payout_pct

6. CONTINGENT AWARDS (typically from prose disclosure)
   - total_contingent_awards
   - contingent_cash_settled
   - contingent_equity_settled

7. VALUATION INPUTS (from Black-Scholes/Monte Carlo input tables)
   - valuation_model
   - stock_price, strike_price, volatility, dividend yield, 
     risk-free rate, expected life, fair value per option

8. TRANCHES (from per-grant detail tables)
   - One entry per grant date
   - grant_date, grant_price, shares_at_period_end,
     exercise_price, vesting_period_years, fair_value

9. PRIOR YEAR (from comparative columns OR "(prior year: X)" prose)
   - All same fields as current year

10. COMPANY METADATA
    - company_name, report_period, currency, reporting_standard

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT YOU IGNORE (DO NOT EXTRACT)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Even if these appear on the page, IGNORE them:

▷ ACCOUNTING POLICY TEXT
  - "The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is 
     recognised as an employee expense..."
  - "A deferred tax asset is recognised on..."
  - "Where the Company grants options over its own shares..."

▷ EXPENSE LINE ITEMS (P&L charges, not options data)
  - "Share-based payment expense: £4.5m"
  - "Total charge for the year:..."

▷ PERFORMANCE CONDITION FULL DETAILS
  - Long lists of TSR peer companies
  - Detailed ESG metric thresholds
  - Bullet lists of performance conditions
  → Only capture a SHORT summary in performance_conditions

▷ SHARE CAPITAL DATA (different from options)
  - "Shares issued during the year: 52,000"
  - "Buyback and cancellation: 1,631,263"
  - "Treasury shares held"

▷ DIRECTOR-LEVEL HOLDINGS
  - Individual named director awards
  - Personal beneficial interests

▷ CROSS-REFERENCES
  - "See note 23 for details..."
  - "Refer to the Remuneration Report..."

▷ NARRATIVE INTRODUCTIONS
  - "The Group operates a long-term incentive plan ('LTIP')..."
  - "Awards are granted at the discretion of..."
  - Plan eligibility descriptions

▷ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
  - "Future awards may be granted..."
  - "The Committee intends to..."

▷ FOOTNOTE LETTERS AND PAGE FURNITURE
  - "(a) Represents the number of shares..."
  - Page numbers, headers like "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / NOTES"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE EXTRACTION MINDSET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

On any given page:
  • 30-60% may be narrative/policy → IGNORE
  • 20-50% may be data in TABLES → EXTRACT
  • 10-30% may be data in PROSE → EXTRACT (this is often missed!)
  
Your job:
  ✓ Find NUMERIC FACTS wherever they live (tables, prose, footnotes)
  ✓ Match each fact to the correct schema field
  ✓ Handle BOTH tabular AND prose formats with equal skill
  ✓ Skip everything else

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. OUTPUT FORMAT
   - Return ONLY valid JSON
   - No markdown, no explanations

2. PLAN SEPARATION
   - Each distinct plan = separate entry in plans[]
   - Multi-column tables (LTIP|DBP|SAYE) → 3 separate entries
   - Combined plans named together ("LTIP, DBP") → 1 entry

3. NUMBER NORMALIZATION
   - exercised/lapsed/forfeited stored as POSITIVE
   - (704) → 704
   - -596 → 596
   - The field name implies the direction

4. NEVER INVENT DATA
   - null for missing fields
   - "—" or "–" or blank = null
   - DON'T infer values that aren't disclosed
   - DON'T copy prior year as current year if current is blank

5. UNITS HANDLING
   - "in thousands" → store AS SHOWN, set units_label = "thousands"
     (so "4,603" in thousands stays as 4603, not 4,603,000)
   - 1,632.0p means 1632.0 PENCE (not 1.632 pounds)
   - "(£)" means pounds; "(p)" means pence
   - "$" means dollars (assume USD unless otherwise specified)

6. PROSE NUMBER EXTRACTION
   - "X (prior year: Y)" → current = X, prior_year = Y
   - "of which Y" → split component = Y
   - "in the range of X to Y" → low = X, high = Y
   - "is 11,306,567" → exact number 11306567 (remove commas)

7. PRIOR YEAR DATA
   - Side-by-side columns → populate prior_year object
   - Inline references like "(2023 – X)" or "(prior year: Y)" → prior_year
   - DON'T mix current and prior in same field

8. CONTINGENT AWARDS (Asian/Singapore RSU style)
   - For nil-cost plans (RSU, PSP, Founders PSP)
   - Use total_contingent_awards (not opening_balance)
   - Capture cash-settled / equity-settled split if disclosed
   - exercise_price stays null (correct — these are free shares)

9. TRANCHE DETAILS
   - Per-grant tables → tranches[] array
   - Each grant date row = one tranche entry
   - Capture all disclosed details per tranche

10. VALUATION INPUTS
    - Look for tables/sections with: volatility, risk-free rate,
      dividend yield, expected life, fair value
    - If per-tranche, also populate tranches[].valuation fields

11. PLAN TYPE CODES
    LTIP, PSP, RSU, PSU, SAYE, CSOP, ESOP, DEFERRED_BONUS,
    FOUNDERS_PSP, RSP, SRSOS, WARRANT, SAR, ESPP, OTHER

12. COMPANY METADATA
    - From page headers, footers, or report titles
    - report_period: "Year ended X" or "Six-month period ended X"
    - currency: detect from £/$/¥/€/S$/HK$ symbols or unit labels

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXTRACTION WORKFLOW (FOLLOW IN ORDER)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: SCAN ALL DATA FORMS
Look at every element on the page:
  □ Main tables (roll-forward, valuation inputs)
  □ Secondary tables (tranches, grants)
  □ Paragraph text with embedded numbers
  □ Footnotes with numeric content
  □ Column headers and row labels

STEP 2: IDENTIFY PLANS
Count distinct plans on the page:
  • Each table column with a plan name = 1 plan
  • Each prose disclosure with a plan name = 1 plan
  • Same plan in table + prose = 1 plan (merge data)

STEP 3: EXTRACT FROM TABLES
For each table:
  • Identify column headers (year, plan, metric type)
  • Match each cell to schema fields
  • Watch for units in headers
  • Handle parenthesized negatives as positive
  
STEP 4: EXTRACT FROM PROSE
For each paragraph with numbers:
  • Identify which plan it describes
  • Extract numeric facts using patterns:
    - "X (prior year: Y)" → current and prior
    - "in the range of X to Y" → low and high
    - "of which Y are cash-settled" → component split
    - "weighted average contractual life of X years" → time field
    - "fair value of $X" → valuation field
  
STEP 5: MERGE TABLE + PROSE DATA
If same plan has data in both table AND prose:
  • Table provides roll-forward, prices
  • Prose provides ranges, contractual life, share prices at exercise
  • Combine into ONE plan entry

STEP 6: EXTRACT TRANCHES (if present)
For per-grant tables (typically below main roll-forward):
  • Each row = one tranche entry
  • Capture grant_date, grant_price, shares_at_period_end,
    exercise_price, vesting_period

STEP 7: EXTRACT VALUATION INPUTS (if present)
For Black-Scholes/Monte Carlo tables:
  • Populate valuation_inputs object
  • If per-tranche, also populate tranches[].valuation fields

Scan EVERY paragraph and EVERY table.
Numbers may live in prose, not just tables.
Look for "(prior year: X)", "in the range of X to Y", "is X (Y: Z)" patterns.
Extract from ALL formats: tables, prose, footnotes, hybrid layouts."""


VALIDATION_PROMPT = """You previously extracted share-based compensation data from financial report pages. Now validate and correct your extraction.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
VALIDATION CHECKS (PERFORM IN ORDER)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ROLL-FORWARD ARITHMETIC
   For each plan, verify:
     opening_balance + granted - exercised - forfeited_or_lapsed ≈ closing_balance
   Tolerance: 1 unit or 1% (rounding)
   If math fails, re-read source — likely a number was misread from wrong column.

2. COMPLETENESS CHECK
   - Every PLAN with disclosed data captured in plans[]?
   - Multi-plan tables (LTIP|DBP|SAYE) split into SEPARATE entries?
   - All ROWS of multi-row tables read?
   - Prior year COLUMNS populated where present?

3. PROSE DATA EXTRACTION CHECK ★ MOST IMPORTANT
   Re-read every PARAGRAPH on the page. Did you miss:
   - "X (prior year: Y)" patterns?
   - "in the range of X to Y"?
   - "weighted average contractual life of X years"?
   - "weighted average share price at the date of exercise was X"?
   - "of which Y are cash-settled"?
   - "is X (date: Y)" disclosures?
   - "fair value of the awards granted was $X"?
   
   These often contain CRITICAL data that's NOT in any table.

4. SUPPLEMENTARY PROSE CHECK
   After every table, check for follow-up sentences. Did you extract:
   - exercise_price_range from prose?
   - weighted_avg_remaining_contractual_life from prose?
   - weighted_avg_share_price_at_exercise from prose?

5. CONTINGENT AWARDS PROSE CHECK
   If page has Asian/Singapore prose disclosures:
   - Did you extract total_contingent_awards?
   - Did you extract contingent_cash_settled?
   - Did you populate prior_year from "(prior date: Y)" patterns?

6. TRANCHE EXTRACTION CHECK
   If page has per-grant tables (with dates like "1st Nov 2024"):
   - Did you create tranches[] entries?
   - Did you capture grant_date, exercise_price, shares_at_period_end,
     vesting_period for each row?

7. VALUATION INPUTS CHECK
   If page has Black-Scholes / Monte Carlo input tables:
   - Did you capture valuation_model?
   - Did you populate valuation_inputs object?
   - Did you also populate per-tranche valuation fields if shown?

8. COLUMN ALIGNMENT
   - Did you mix current year and prior year columns?
   - Did you mix data between different plan columns?

9. UNITS CORRECTNESS
   - "(p)" = pence; "(£)" = pounds; "$" = dollars
   - 1632.0p means 1632.0 PENCE (not 1.632 pounds)
   - "in thousands" → store AS SHOWN, set units_label = "thousands"
   - Currency normalized (GBP, USD, SGD, etc.)

10. SIGN CONVENTION
    - exercised, forfeited_or_lapsed, vested are POSITIVE
    - (1,088) → store as 1088

11. NULL VS ZERO
    - "—" or "–" or blank = null
    - Explicit "0" = 0
    - Don't change null to 0

12. CHECK FOR HALLUCINATED DATA
    - Any values not present in source?
    - Any fields populated where source shows "—"?
    - REMOVE invented data (set to null)

13. CHECK FOR MISSED DATA
    - Any tables not extracted?
    - Any prose paragraphs with numbers not extracted?
    - Any plans mentioned but missing from plans[]?

14. FILTER NON-OPTIONS DATA
    - Did you accidentally extract SHARE CAPITAL data? REMOVE
    - Did you extract EPS dilution? REMOVE
    - Did you extract DIRECTOR individual holdings? REMOVE
    - Did you extract SBP expense (P&L line)? REMOVE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Return the CORRECTED JSON object only.
- If extraction was perfect, return unchanged
- If errors found, return the corrected version
- Maintain exact schema structure
- No explanations, no markdown
- Start with {{ and end with }}

Pay SPECIAL attention to data hidden in PROSE/PARAGRAPHS that may have 
been missed in Pass 1. This is the most common extraction failure."""
